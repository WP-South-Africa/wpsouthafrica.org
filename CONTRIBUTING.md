# How to contribute

Community made patches, localisations, bug reports and contributions are always welcome - this is a community-built website after all!

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a WordPress support question don't post here. Please [join the community Slack group](https://wpsouthafrica.org/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation) to connect with others in the community.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/) for all languages.**
* When committing, reference your issue (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the *master* branch of this repository.

At this point, you are waiting for your pull request to be merged - feel free to ask about it in the [#asktheadmins](https://wpsa.slack.com/messages/asktheadmins) channel in the [WPSA Slack](https://wpsa.slack.com/) group.
